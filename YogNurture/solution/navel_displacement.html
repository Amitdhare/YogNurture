    <h1>Navel Displacement (Nabhi Khiskna)</h1>
    <p class="intro">Navel displacement is a condition where the navel shifts from its normal position, causing issues
      such as digestive problems, constipation, abdominal pain, and anxiety. Yoga and meditation can help in healing and
      bringing the navel back to its natural alignment.</p>
